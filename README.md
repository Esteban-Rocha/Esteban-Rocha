    Lo, I am a Software Engineer of the finest caliber, who doth take great pleasure in the pursuit of Strict/Strong Typing, Unix Shells, Monoliths, and Mechanical Keyboards. 
    <br><br>
    Hark, good sir or madam, who doth possess many a year of experience creating web applications using a wide array of technologies, including but not limited to PHP 8, JavaScript, Laravel, and WordPress. My primary focus and area of expertise lies in the realm of Full-Stack Monolithic web applications, using RemixJS and NextJS with JavaScript, Laravel with PHP, and Tokio.rs with Rust.
    <br><br>
    Verily, for all other pursuits, I am focused on Rust for CLI and Desktop applications. And, I am most exceptionally proficient in the art of Bash Scripting and in the workings of Unix-based systems and shells.
    <br><br>
    Pray, I am blunt, but my intentions are ever pure and free from malice. I mean no harm, but speak with honesty and forthrightness, as befits a gentleman of my standing.
